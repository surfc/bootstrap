CAD: https://www.pololu.com/file/0J1060/micro-metal-gearmotor-standard.step

I have a selection of different ratios and gearboxs, e.g. right angled, 180deg angled.

### N10 Micro Metal Gearbox Motors
Same as the N20 but smaller/shorter motors.
I don't have many of these.

## Speed Controllers

I have a number of these https://shop.bristolbotbuilders.com/product/redesc/
They solder directly to N20/N10 motors and plug into the recovers.
